#4.3 Counting to Twenty
numbers = list(range(1, 21))

for number in numbers:
    print(number)

#4.4 One Million: 
numbers = list(range(1, 1000001))

for number in numbers:
    print(number)
# (If the output is taking too long, stop it by pressing CTRL-C or by closing the output window.)


#4.5 Summing a Million: 
numbers = list(range(1, 1_000_001))

print(min(numbers))
print(max(numbers))
print(sum(numbers))


#4.6. Odd Numbers: 
Use the third argument of the range() function to make a list of the odd
numbers from 1 to 20. Use a for loop to print each number.
numbers = list(range(1, 21))
print(numbers)


#4.7 Threes: 
threes = list(range(3, 31, 3))

for number in threes:
    print(number)

#4.8 Cubes: 
cubes = []
for number in range(1, 11):
    cube = number**3
    cubes.append(cube)

for cube in cubes:
    print(cube)


#4.9 Cube Comprehension
cubes = [number**3 for number in range(1,11)]

for cube in cubes:
    print(cube)

#4.10 Slices: 
Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several lines to the end
of the program that do the following:
Print the message The first three items in the list are:. Then use a
slice to print the first three items from that program’s list.
Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are:. Use a
slice to print three items from the middle of the list.
Print the message 

print (f"The last three items in the list are:." Use a slice to
print the last three items in the list.

#4.11
myPizzas = ['Margarita', 'Vegetarian', '4Cheeses']
friend_pizzas = myPizzas[:]

myPizzas.append("vegan")
friend_pizzas.append('avo & feta')

print("My favorite pizzas are:")
for pizza in myPizzas:
    print(f"- {pizza}")

print("\nMy friend's favorite pizzas are:")
for pizza in friend_pizzas:
    print(f"- {pizza}")


#4.12 More Loops: 
All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using for loops when
printing to save space. Choose a version of foods.py, and write two for loops to print each list of
foods.

#4.13 Buffet:

basic_menu = (
    "beyond beef burger", "veggie spring roll", "grilled cheese", "ice-cream sunday", "ice-coffee",
)

print("These are the items you can choose from: ")
for item in basic_menu:
    print(f"- {item}")

print("\nOur menu has been updated.")

# Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects
# the change.
# The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with
# different foods. Add a line that rewrites the tuple, and then use a
# for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.

# PEP 8: Look through the original PEP 8 style guide at https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. 

#4.15 Code Review:
# Choose three of the programs you’ve written in this chapter and modify
# each one to comply with PEP 8:
# Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to
# insert four spaces every time you press TAB, if you haven’t already
# done so (see Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).
# Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to
# show a vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
# Don’t use blank lines excessively in your program files.
